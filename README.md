# Username Checker

Username Checker written in JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- Have node [installed](<https://nodejs.org/en/download>)
- Have [pnpm](<https://pnpm.io/installation>) installed globally (recommended)

## How do I use this?

- Run `pnpm install` or `npm install`
- Put the usernames you want to check inside of the `usernames.txt` file
- Open up a terminal and run `node .` or `node index.js`
- Now all the available usernames will be saved in `available_usernames.txt`

## Notice

- Please be aware that some sites prevent this method of checking names. Consequently, the effectiveness of this approach may be limited in such cases.
- Additionally, it is important to note that usernames that are considered "banned" may erroneously appear as available, despite being unavailable.
